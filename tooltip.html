		<p><h2>Varun Aditya's passion for photography</h2></p>
		<p>What you do and the difficulties you face is are different and being a photographer is actually easy says Varun Aditya</p>
		<br>
		<p>Q: What was the starting point of your passion for photography and how did you approach it to become the fine photographer that you are today?
			<br>
			Ans: My starting point in short was when I was doing my post graduation in London. That was in MBA business and nothing related to photography. I didn’t have much of friends over there because I was cornered and bullied in my childhood so the same thing reflected in my post graduation because of lot of inferiority complexes, so I really wanted a companion so I bought a camera. Before that I started photographing with iphone 3s in 20210. I started roaming around London started taking picture of things around, started with street photography. And then I just bought my first camera and started posting. For a person who was really less motivated person like me. When I posted at first on Orkut and Facebook, I really got 5 – 10 like and took it to my heart because no one really appreciated me before I had never tasted motivation. That was such a boost for me that from there onwards nothing stopped me. Just for that appreciation just for that motivation that I had never experienced it. T was very very slow learning process because I hated school, I hated whole method of teaching, where ever I studied. This was so affected that even now you can call me a fine photographer. I am learning everyday we are learning everyday. Art is such that it makes us learn everyday even if you make mistake.<br><br>
		Q: Where all have you travelled for photography? According to you, which location is a paradise for photographers and why?<br>

Ans: I have travelled, that’s going to be a big list. I have travelled a lot.<br><br>

Q: How important is research on a photography subject?<br>

Ans: Research in lens and camera is one topic and other topic is research into the subject of the photography. Before that I would like to tell something, that I recent days, this digital photogarphy era people are complicating a lot with numbers, when I say numbers I mean shutter speed, aperture and these numbers for identification purpose. You may ask how and why, that’s because you need to start on the mobile phone. On mobile phone there are just 2-3 options photo and video. On phone you will increase the brightness and decrease the brightness, its very simple.</p>
