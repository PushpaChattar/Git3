	<h4>When it comes to geographically, we all know how beautiful India is. I love to travel to different places whether it is mountains, beaches, meadows or desert but there is one thing which took all my attention recently is 'Wildlife of India'. I wish I can tell you how rich our country is when it comes to different animals as well as birds. I realized all of these things on my recent trip to Kabini forest, where I witnessed the beauty of nature and how these beautiful animals roam in their habitat freely. After this trip, I decided to follow these beautiful wildlife photographers who inspire me everyday to explore all the national parks and wildlife sanctuaries of India. We all should learn compassion and love for wildlife from these photographers. So, follow these photographers who can make you fall in love with nature and wildlife through their pictures.</h4>
